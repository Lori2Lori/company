My personal website
===================

Hello.

This is the source code of my personal website. The live version is available at http://lazurski.pl/.

I'm a big fan of preprocessors, tools and automation. The sources are written in:

`HTML`  :
  [Teacup](http://goodeggs.github.io/teacup/) with [my own little wrapper](https://github.com/Mikrosekcja/teacup-view)

`CSS` :
  [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)

`JS`  :
  [Browserified](http://browserify.org/) [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)

You can fork it and build it yourself like this:

```
npm install
npm run prepublish
```

Or start development process with watching and local HTTP server with

```
npm run develop
```
