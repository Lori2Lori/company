Daft Code Exercise
==================

Hello.

Thanks for the exercise. It was quite fun and I even learned a bit new stuff about CSS :)

This is a git repository. In `build` there are files ready for inspection. I'm a big fan of preprocessors, tools and automation. The soures are written in:

`HTML`  :
  [Teacup](http://goodeggs.github.io/teacup/) with [my own little wrapper](https://github.com/Mikrosekcja/teacup-view)

`CSS` :
  [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)

`JS`  :
  [Browserified](http://browserify.org/) [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)

You can build it yourself like this:

```
npm install
npm run prepublish
```

Or start development process with watching and local HTTP server with

```
npm run develop
```

I haven't got much time to test it on different browsers or pursue pixel perfection, but I've tried my best. Hope you'll like it and that it sufficiently demonstrates my skills.

Notes
-----

The body copy text in provided image of desktop version is not horizontally aligned. I have corrected it in my implementation.

The header font size on provided images is obviously different for desktop and tablet / mobile versions. It is not mentioned in the instruction. I tried to estimate the size from the images and applied it to CSS.
